## Running the Game

One-liner:

    curl -s https://raw.github.com/zachlatta/pwned/master/pwned.sh > /tmp/pwned.sh && sh /tmp/pwned.sh

This downloads the game, stores it in `/tmp/pwned.sh`, and runs it. If you'd
prefer to see the contents of the script before executing it, run the
following.

    curl https://raw.github.com/zachlatta/pwned/master/pwned.sh
